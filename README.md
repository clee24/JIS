This project utilizes integration with google collab and drive. Here's a basic outline of how we plan to achieve volleyball serve classification:

1. Data Collection:
Gather a dataset of volleyball serve videos. This dataset should include examples of different types of serves we want to classify.

3. Preprocessing:
Extract frames from the videos.
Use AlphaPose to detect human poses in each frame.

4. Feature Extraction:
Use the detected poses to extract relevant features from the json. This could be angles between joints, velocities, etc.

6. Training:
Train a machine learning model on these extracted features to classify different types of serves.
You could use a variety of algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or Neural Networks. We might use libraries like scikit-learn for simpler models or TensorFlow/PyTorch for neural networks.

8. Testing and Validation:
Split your dataset into training and testing sets.
Test the trained model on the testing set to evaluate its performance.
Adjust parameters and retrain as necessary.

10. Integration with AlphaPose:
Once your model is trained and validated, you can integrate it with AlphaPose.
Run AlphaPose on new volleyball serve videos to detect poses.
Use the output poses as input to your trained model to classify the type of serve.
